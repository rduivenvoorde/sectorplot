The SectorPlot plugin is a plugin to create SectorPlots in QGIS.

It needs some background services to run:

- JRodos-REST service (to retrieve NPP-data)

- Geoserver (to push sectors to)

- PostGIS db with a sectorplot table (see sql/sector_pg1.sql)

All documentation (sphinx based, both user and development) is available via html in Web/Sectorplot/Documentation
